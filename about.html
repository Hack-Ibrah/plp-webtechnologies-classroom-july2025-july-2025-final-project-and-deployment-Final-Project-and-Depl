              Art has always been a part of me. From sketching with pencils to creating 
              detailed graphite drawings, I‚Äôve dedicated countless hours to perfecting 
              my craft. I use art as a way to express emotions, tell stories, and 
              preserve memories.
              Over time, my sketches evolved into a signature style‚Äîlayered with vulnerability, 
              cinematic tension, and spiritual undertones. I began selling my work, not just as art, 
              but as emotional experiences. Each piece became a conversation starter, a legacy fragment, 
              and a way to connect with others beyond words.
              Then came the moment that changed everything: being featured on Citizen TV. 
              That spotlight wasn‚Äôt just about recognition‚Äîit was a celebration of resilience, 
              of starting from zero and daring to dream.
              It affirmed that art, when rooted in truth and purpose, can reach hearts across screens and borders.

              Over the years, I‚Äôve worked with painting, photography, and modern 
              digital techniques, blending creativity with technology.

            <p>
              Beyond art, I am passionate about fitness and sports. I enjoy going to 
              the gym regularly and I also play badminton. These activities keep me 
              energized, disciplined, and creative in my daily life.
              I‚Äôm Ibrahim, a coastal soul with a competitive edge and a deep respect for discipline‚Äîon 
              and off the court. Badminton is my rhythm sport: fast-paced, strategic, 
              and deeply meditative. Whether it‚Äôs a solo rally or a doubles match, 
              I thrive on precision, agility, and the quiet thrill of outsmarting my opponent 
              with a well-placed drop shot. It‚Äôs not just a game‚Äî
              it‚Äôs a metaphor for life: stay light, stay sharp, and always return.
              The gym is my sanctuary for growth and grit. I train not just for strength, 
              but for clarity and consistency. Every rep is a reminder that transformation is earned, 
              not given. I focus on functional fitness, endurance, and mobility‚Äîbuilding a body that supports my creative 
              and educational missions. Whether I‚Äôm lifting weights or stretching through recovery, 
              I treat movement as a form of self-respect.
